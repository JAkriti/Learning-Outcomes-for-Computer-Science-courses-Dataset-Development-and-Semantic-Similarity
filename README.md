# Learning Outcomes for Computer Science Undergraduate Courses: Dataset Development and Semantic Similarity
 
We aim to propose a database of learning outcomes from ten major Computer Science courses offered
by undergraduate programs at the worldâ€™s leading universities. Furthermore, we attempt to analyse the semantic similarity between learning outcomes that provides a basis for identifying how similar the undergraduate curriculum is across universities. 

The file 'Dataset_LOs' contains the dataset of learning outcomes extracted from universities listed in the top 50 QS ranking. 

We implemented various transformer-based models to compute the semantic similarity between learning outcomes for which the code is provided in 'similarity_nlpmodels.py'. 
Based on the overall similarity between learning outcomes, the similarity score between universities is provided in 'University_Similarity_Scores'.

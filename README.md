# Learning Outcomes for Computer Science Undergraduate Courses: Dataset Development and Semantic Similarity
 
We aim to propose a database of learning outcomes from ten major Computer Science courses offered
by undergraduate programs at the worldâ€™s leading universities. Furthermore, we attempt to analyse the semantic similarity between learning outcomes that provides a basis for identifying how similar the undergraduate curriculum is across universities.
